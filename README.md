E-Commerce Sales Analysis Project

Project Overview
This project represents a complete sales data analysis workflow, starting with database creation and data insertion in SQL, continuing with data validation and pivot analysis in Excel, and finishing with interactive dashboards in Power BI.
The goal of the project is to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and revenue trends using realistic e-commerce data.

MySQL – Database Design & Analysis
Database Structure
A relational database was designed and created from scratch using MySQL.
Tables:
•	categories
•	customers
•	products
•	orders
•	order_items
Key concepts used:
•	Primary keys & foreign keys
•	One-to-many relationships
________________________________________
SQL Operations
The database was populated with sample data and analyzed using advanced SQL queries.
SQL techniques applied:
•	JOIN (INNER JOIN)
•	GROUP BY, ORDER BY
•	Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT)
•	HAVING clause
•	Subqueries
•	VIEW creation for reusable logic

Business Analysis Queries
•	Total revenue
•	Total value per order
•	Customer revenue analysis
•	Customers with multiple orders
•	Average Order Value (AOV)
•	Orders above a certain value
•	Revenue by product category
•	Top products by quantity and revenue

Excel – Data Validation & Pivot Analysis
The exported SQL dataset was imported into Excel for additional validation and exploratory analysis.
Excel Activities
•	Data consistency checks
•	Creating Pivot Tables:
o	Total sales by category and Year
o	Sales by month
o	Top customers by revenue
o	Average Order Value (AOV)
•	Basic charts to verify trends and distributions

Power BI – Interactive Dashboard
Power BI was used to create an interactive and business-oriented dashboard for sales analysis.
Measures (DAX)
•	Total Orders
•	Average Order Value (AOV)
Visualizations
•	Year Slicer – dynamic filtering by year
•	Card: Total Orders
•	Card: Average Order Value
•	Clustered Column Chart: Total Sales by Year
•	Donut Chart: Monthly Sales Trend
•	Clustered Column Chart: Total Revenue by Category
•	Clustered Column Chart: Top Customers by Revenue
